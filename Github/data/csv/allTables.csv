""
This Quick Start Setup guide can be used by experienced instrumentation technicians to configure the
sensor using the Zero and Span actuators or via the optional HART communications. For more
detailed information, please consult the complete manual before operating. The Quick Start
procedure is intended for users already familiar with the use of Melt Pressure Sensors and
Instrumentation.
""
1. Insure the process connection is clean and clear of any debris and is machined to the
proper dimensions. Machine tool kits with port gages are available (see sections 6 &
12 of manual)
""
2. Apply anti?seize as appropriate then install the sensor into the process connection.
"(Do NOT torque sensor into the hole at this time!)"
""
3. Allow time for the sensor temperature to equalize to the process temperature. This will
help eliminate thread galling and ease removal later. There should be NO pressure
applied at this time.
""
4. Connect power to the sensor using the chart below. Standard configurations shown.

1 VERTEX CARE ANDHANDLING
""
Be sure that the port where the Vertex transducer will be installed is free of all residual dried polymer
from previous manufacturing processes (This is accomplished using Dynisco's machine whole tooling
kit part number 200100).
In applications where the Vertex transducer will be removed in between production runs, such as in
the manufacture of food products or medical tubing, only remove the Vertex when the polymer is at,
or near, full process temperature. This will insure that you are pulling the transducer tip from molten
conditions and therefore not causing any undue pulling effect on the diaphragm that could result in
damage to the tip and a transducer that is then out of specification.
If there is residual polymer material on the tip when the sensor is removed from a process port,
NEVER use a wire brush, wire wheel, blunt or sharp instrument to remove the polymer. There
are two acceptable ways of removing residual material from the tip of any pressure sensor:
After removing the Vertex sensor, carefully clean the diaphragm with a soft cloth or bronze wool
while the medium is still malleable. Do not attempt to clean the sensor by heating solidified polymer
with a torch.
A solvent bath consisting of glycol can be used to soften the polymer and improve removal. Place the
tip of the sensor into the solvent bath for a period of time as determined by when the residual
polymer softens. Be careful to not immerse the electronics in the bath. This bath can be heated using
heat elements to increase removal effectiveness and shorten cycle time. Then follow procedure “a.”
above.
When installing the Vertex sensor, it is important not to over?torque the unit into place. The unit
should be hand tightened, and then tightened to the installation torque specified in section 4.4 with a
torque wrench.
Adjust zero after installing and heating the machine to operating temperature. Where filled
sensors are sensitive to vertical orientation changes, Vertex is sensitive to horizontal orientation
changes and installation torque. Reduce zero?shift impact by setting zero and span after properly
installing the sensor in the process port.
""
Do not adjust the Span potentiometer with Rcal activated. Span potentiometer adjustments should
only be made with the unit installed into a calibrated pressure source at FS pressure.

2.5 NAMING CONVENTION
""
Vertex Vertex Brand Pressure Sensor
""
2.6 TRANSMITTER PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
The mechanical system consists of a diaphragm located on the sensor tip. The diaphragm is a
metal plate designed to deflect in response to pressure applied to the tip. The diaphragm is in
direct contact with the fluid media (gas or liquid) to be measured and its purpose is to convert the
pressure of the media to mechanical deflection.
""
Inside the sensor, the diaphragm plate deflection is converted to a mV electrical signal. Electronic
circuitry performs the signal conditioning necessary to convert that signal into the output (mV/V or
4?20mA or voltage).
""
An optional J or K?thermocouple process temperature output is also available. These outputs are
from a customer accessible thermocouple included in the snout tip.
An optional shunt calibration (Rcal) output is also available. Rcal is a method of generating an electrical
output to match the electrical output that would be given in response to an applied pressure. Rcal is
normally set to 80%FS so that all similar sensors calibrate at the same point to facilitate
interchangeability.
""
Rcal traces its routes to strain gage transducers. In strain gage technology, Rcal is normally a resistor
inserted into the Wheatstone bridge to offset its output as if 80% pressure was applied. In the Vertex
brand sensor, Rcal is an electrical simulation of 80% pressure and is created in the electronics
circuitry. Do not adjust the Span potentiometer with Rcal activated. Span potentiometer adjustments
should only be made with the unit installed into a calibrated pressure source at FS pressure.
""
2.7 CORRECT USE
When using a Vertex brand sensor as a safety component in accordance with the EC Machine
Directive, Annex IIc, the equipment manufacturer must take any necessary precautions to ensure that
malfunction of the PT cannot cause damage or injury.
""
""
For installation in explosive gas atmospheres the device must be installed in accordance with
European installation guidelines EN 60079?14. For category 1 (zone 0) installations, over voltage
protection of the electrical connections shall be in accordance to EN 60079?14.
""
When planning machinery and using one of the sensors from the Vertex brand sensor Family, follow
the safety and accident prevention regulations that apply to your application, such as:
""
"? EN 60204, Electrical equipment in machines"
"? EN 12100, Machine safety, general design guidelines"
"? DIN 57 100 Part 410, Protection against electric shock"
"? EN 60079?0 Explosive atmospheres ? General Requirements"
"? EN 60079?11 Explosive atmospheres ? Intrinsically Safe Apparatus"
"? EN 60079?26 Special Requirements for EPL Ga"
""

6.1 SENSOR AS?RECEIVED
Note? The Vertex threads and tip have a straw colored heat tint because each sensor is
conditioned to very high temperatures prior and during calibration. The diaphragm tip also
has a Dymax coating.  After conditioning, each sensor is then polished up to the threads for
aesthetics (see following fig.) It is not necessary to clean the threads or remove the oxide
from the tip. If there are specific cleanliness requirements for your process, refer to section
1 for how to clean the Vertex tip.
6.2 GENERAL MOUNTING INFORMATION
Protect the tip/diaphragm
Do not remove the protective cap on the Vertex brand sensor snout tip until ready to install. If the cap is not in
place, do not allow the tip to strike any object – the diaphragm may be dented inadvertently. Aluminum thread
caps can be ordered from Dynisco for best protection of the diaphragm tip on spare sensors.  (Part numbers can
be found in section 12).
Check the port before mounting the sensor
Before mounting the Vertex brand sensor, check the process connection carefully. The Vertex brand Sensor must
only be mounted in process connections that satisfy the requirements below. A process connection that does
not satisfy these requirements can damage the sensor.
""
Damage to the sensor is commonly caused by installing into an improperly machined hole. By forcing a snout
into an undersized or eccentric hole, the sensor diaphragm may be damaged and as a result the sensor may not
function as specified.
""
Insure the process connection is clear of any debris and is machined to the proper dimensions. Dynisco offers a
cleaning tool kit designed for use in removing excess plastic from standard mounting holes for pressure and
temperature sensors.  (See manual section 12).
""
The abrasion from threading a sensor into a mounting hole with an incorrect thread size may damage the sensor
threads. This damage may prevent a proper seal, resulting in material leakage, and the instrument may not
function as specified. The proper dimensions for the mounting hole must be used to avoid thread galling
"(welding via diffusion at point contacts over time at temperature and pressure). The threads are, an industry"
standard of 1?2 ? 20 UNF 2B. A mounting well gage plug should be used to verify that the mounting hole is
correctly machined and cleaned.
""
It is good practice to check the mounting hole before installing the sensor. One procedure is to coat a gauge plug
"(Included in the cleaning kit, or available separately ? see section 12 for part numbers) with Dykem machine blue"
on surfaces below the thread. Insert the gauge plug into the mounting hole and rotate the plug until surface
binding is encountered. Remove and inspect. Blue should only be scraped off of the 45 degree sealing chamfer. If
blue has been removed from other surfaces, the mounting hole has not been machined properly.
""
Machining a port
For cases when a hole must be machined for the sensor, Dynisco offers a Transducer Mounting Hole Machining
Tool Kit (See section 12). The Machining kit contains all of the necessary drills and taps to prepare a standard 1/2
"? 20 UNF sensor mounting hole. The kit contains the special pilot drill required to machine the 45 degree seat."
"(Consult Dynisco for additional information or information about kits for other Mounting holes.)"
""
Careful attention should be paid to correctly machine the mounting port. Failure to use the recommended
mounting port may result in erroneous pressure measurement, difficult sensor removal, premature sensor
failure, process fluid leaks, and personnel hazard.
Positioning a sensor requires input from a Process Engineer. Bear in mind that when a sensor is positioned
too far upstream in the barrel, un?melted plastic pellets may abrade against the transducer tip, resulting in
damage.
After verifying the port, prepare the tip
In applications such as plastics extrusion involving high temperature operation and/or repeated
thermal cycling a good high quality anti?seize compound should be applied to the threaded
surfaces of the sensor and 45° seat before mounting. (High temperature anti?seize compound
prevents seizing, galling, and cold welding of the sensor.) Make sure that anti?seize does not
contaminate the wetted surfaces if it is not compatible with the process.
""
Install the Sensor
After applying the anti?seize, install the sensor into the mounting hole. Allow time for the sensor
snout temperature to equalize to the process temperature before tightening the sensor. This will
help eliminate thread galling and ease removal later. There should be NO pressure applied at this
time.
""
After temperatures have equalized tighten the sensor into the mounting hole. Always use a torque
wrench applied to the designated wrench flats while screwing the sensor in and out. Do not
exceed the torque specification, in section
4.4 or apply the tool to the housing or housing/sensor connection.
""
During installation, take care not to damage the electrical connector. This is probably the most
vulnerable part of the Sensor, other than the sensing diaphragm itself. Denting the connector shell
or bending a pin could put the sensor out of commission.
""
When installing a sensor with a flex, use the mounting bracket provided to secure the electronics
housing. Take care to align the housing so the zero and span adjustment access holes can be
reached with a screwdriver. Make sure that the electronics is not secured while installing or
removing the sensor from the mounting port though.The electronics must be free to rotate as
the snout rotates. Avoid kinking or crushing the flexible stem. Do not violate the minimum flex
bend radius as specified in section 4.4.
Attempt to minimize exposure to high temperatures
The Vertex brand sensor can be used in media temperatures up to +4000C (based on configuration).
As stated in the temperature specifications section (section 4.5) of this manual, the maximum
allowed operating temperature for the electronics housing is +850C and the maximum allowed
operating temperature of the transition housing is +1500C.
Approximations of the operating temperatures of the housings can be obtained by measuring the
bottom surfaces of the housings closest to the process connection. Exceeding these maximum
operating temperature values can result in PT malfunction and damage. Do not install the PT in
places where these temperatures are exceeded.
The operating temperature of the transition housing can be strongly influenced by the exposed
process connection length.  Exposed process connection length is defined as the length from the end
of the transition electronics enclosure (closest to the process connection) to the point where the
snout enters the process equipment or insulation covering the process equipment.
For rigid configuration PTs (no flex) the operating temperature of the electronics housing can also be
strongly influenced by the exposed process connection length, because the electronics housing is
directly connected to the transition housing in this configuration. For PTs with a flex, the electronics
and transition housings are separated by the flex and therefore the operating temperature of the
electronics housing is more strongly influenced by the ambient temperature.
The installation orientation of the rigid snout with respect to the barrel also has an influence on
transition housing operating temperature.
The temperature rise in the electronics and transition housings due to electrical self heating is
minimal (depending on configuration, approx 5?60C max in the electronics housing and approx 2?30C
max in the transition housing).
Increasing the exposed process connection length can significantly decrease the transition housing
temperature. Similarly, using PTs with a flex will minimize the process temperature influence on the
electronics housing. Orienting the process connection in a horizontal or under the barrel position
instead of directly above the barrel (vertical position) will also decrease the influence of process
temperature.
It is the customer’s responsibility to insure that the maximum specified temperatures of the
electronics enclosures (transition and electronics housing) are not exceeded. Please consult the
factory if you have any questions.
When removing the Sensor
""
Hazard!  To avoid personal injury, verify that no residual pressure remains in the system before
loosening snout. The Vertex sensor can be very hot when removed. WEAR PROTECTIVE GLOVES!
""
Make sure to loosen the electronics mounting bracket before attempting to remove the sensor.
Make sure the barrel is warm enough so that any plastic present in the mounting port will be
malleable while removing the sensor. If a sensor is removed from a cold extruder, material might
adhere to the sensor tip causing damage.
""
The snout may be damaged if threads have seized and excessive torque is applied. Use a torque
wrench to remove the sensor, being careful to exceed to maximum removal torque level as
specified in section 4.4.
""
After removing the Vertex sensor, carefully clean the diaphragm of the sensor with a soft cloth or
bronze wool while the medium is still malleable. Do not attempt to clean the sensor by heating
solidified plastic with a torch.
""
It is important that the sensor mounting holes are kept clean and free of any plastic buildup. Before an
extruder is cleaned, all sensors should be removed from the barrel. When they are removed, plastic is
likely to flow into the mounting holes and harden. If this hard plastic residue is not removed extensive
tip damage will result when the sensors are re?inserted. A cleaning tool kit can be used to remove the
contaminant plastic. It should be noted that overaggressive or repeated cleaning may produce “too
deep” holes and result in damage to the sensor tip. If this is seen, spacers should be used to raise the
sensor.
""
If a transducer is positioned too far back in the mounting hole, a stagnant pool of melted plastic will
build up between the transducer tip and the screw flights. Over time this plastic will degrade to
carbon, which will prevent the transmission of an accurate pressure signal. On the other hand, if the
transducer extends too far into the barrel the screw flights can shear off the unit’s sensor tip.
""
After removing the sensor, the port can be plugged with a hole plug, if necessary. See the accessories
in section 12.
""
Always remove the sensor prior to cleaning the machine with abrasives or steel wire brushes. Also, do
not clean the sensor with hard objects, such as a screwdriver, a wire brush, etc.  This could possibly
damage the sensor.
""
Protect the tip after removal
After removing the sensor, immediately protect the tip by installing the protective cap. Aluminum
thread caps can be ordered from Dynisco for best protection of the diaphragm tip.  (See section 12)
6.3 ELECTRICAL CONNECTION

thermocouple element type. Otherwise, errors can be introduced into your system.

7.5 Rcal OUTPUT ............................................................................................................................................ 34
""
7.1 WHY A SENSOR SHOULD BEREZEROED
The sensor output must be nulled at zero pressure after installation when the machine has
stabilized at operating temperature to correct for temperature effects as well as orientation,
torque, side loading, etc. All of these effects can be compensated for by setting the sensor zero
after the machine has stabilized at operating temperature.
""
Typically, your instrumentation can be used to Rezero the unit. A 4?20mA or voltage unit can also be
rezeroed locally using its actuators.
""
7.2 UTILIZING THE ZERO AND SPANACTUATORS
When the sensor output needs to be corrected due to mounting location and temperature shift, the
zero actuator can be used.  Please wait until the process has been brought to operating temperature
before zeroing.  The zero procedure is only recommended after the process temperature has
stabilized, the snout has been tightened to the specified torque, and the sensor electronics housing
has been permanently installed. Normally a Rezero is all that is required after installation since the
sensor span has been calibrated at the factory. In the event the full scale output is not correct when
checked against a calibrated pressure source or dead weight tester, the sensor span can be adjusted
via the Span actuator. Span adjustments can only be performed when applying a known calibrated
full scale pressure to the sensor.  The span actuator should never be used without zeroing the sensor
with the zero actuator first.
""
Do not adjust the Span potentiometer while Rcal is engaged!
ZERO AND SPAN PROCEDURE
1. Connect Power Supply and readout electronics to Vertex sensor.
2. If commissioning on the bench with a dead weight tester or calibrated pressure source, ensure
pressure connection is free of leaks.
3. Apply power to the Vertex sensor and observe output with zero pressure applied. The output should
indicate zero pressure. If not, proceed to step 4.
4. Perform Zero Function
"? mV/V units can only be zeroed when this feature is available on your indicator/controller. No"
local zero capability.
"? Voltage units can be zeroed using on board zero potentiometer. Remove seal screw and"
adjust potentiometer until desired output is achieved. Replace seal screw when complete.
""	? mA units have a variety of on board Zero Adjustments types (based
""	on configuration), i.e. potentiometer, pushbuttons, and HALL Effect
""	Switches.
""	o For units with potentiometers, remove seal screw and adjust
""	potentiometer until desired output is achieved. Replace seal screw
""	when complete.
""	o For units with pushbuttons, remove seal screw, using a 2mm or smaller
""	Allen Key, depress pushbutton for 1?2 sec, release pushbutton for 1?2 sec,
""	depress pushbutton for 1?2 sec and release. Replace seal screw when
""	complete.
""	o For units with HALL Effect Switches, unthread zero screw from endplate,
""	depress screw, release screw, depress screw, release screw and return
""	screw in endplate (failure to return the screw on units with HALL Effects
""	Switches will cause the unit to go into failsafe).
5.	Steps past this point are not part of a normal bench setup and should only be
""	performed by qualified individuals. The Vertex sensor has been factory calibrated with
""	highly accurate pressure generators. Span adjustment should only be performed on a
""	calibrated pressure generator at 100%FS.
""	
6.	Apply Full Scale pressure and verify output. If output indication is incorrect, adjust the span
""	potentiometer.
""	
""	
7.3 AVOID COLD STARTS!	
In plastics, both the sensor and extruder can be damaged if the extruder is not brought up to	
operating temperature before the machinery begins operating. A sufficient “soak time” must be	
provided for the plastic to go from its solid to molten state before the extruder drive is started.	
""	
""	
7.4 THE OPTIONAL TEMPERATURE OUTPUT	
The sensor can also detect the temperature of the tip. J and K thermocouple outputs are available	
as an option. The thermocouple is an integral part of the sensor/flex assembly and must be	
specified when ordering the sensor. Thermocouple extension wire should be used between the	
sensor and the thermocouple indicator for best accuracy. Changes in metallurgy along the length of	
the thermocouple wiring (such as terminal strips or changes in thermocouple type wire) will	
introduce another undesirable thermocouple junction (which may affect the measurement.)	
7.5 Rcal OUTPUT
""
An optional shunt calibration/Rcal output is also available. Rcal is a method of generating an
electrical output to match the electrical output that would be given in response to an applied
pressure. Rcal is normally set to 80%FS so that all similar sensors calibrate at the same point to
facilitate interchangeability.
""
The Rcal pins on the sensor are normally left open. When the pins are electrically shorted, the sensor
will simulate an applied pressure of 80% of the sensor full scale output. This eliminates the need for a
cumbersome calibrated pressure source when scaling associated instrumentation.
""
The purpose of Rcal is to make it possible to match the sensor to the Pressure Indicator/Controller
with a “two point calibration.” (Two points define a line.) Setting up the instrument in this fashion is
much more accurate through a single point offset adjustment.
""
When the sensor is fully installed and the machine is at operating temperature and at zero pressure,
the indicator may be “zeroed” using whatever mechanism nulls it. Afterward, the Rcal pins on the
sensor may be shorted to simulate a pressure of 80% full scale to complete the calibration and allow
the indicator span to be adjusted.
""
Caution ? Do not adjust Span with Rcal activated. The Rcal signal of Vertex is a fixed voltage added to
the Zero Output.  It is not influenced by Span potentiometer adjustments!

""
The zero procedure is only recommended after the process temperature has stabilized and the
electronics housing has been permanently installed. When the zero trim function is selected (HART
Quick key 1,2,5,1,3,1) the output will be corrected to reflect zero pressure. This is done by the
transmitter electronics automatically by adjusting digital PV to zero and analog output will be 4 mA.
Normally a Zero Trim is all that is required after installation since the Transmitter span has been
calibrated at the factory.
""
In the event the Full Scale output is not correct when checked against a calibrated pressure source or
dead weight tester, the Transmitter span can be adjusted by performing the Sensor Trim function.
This is performed by first applying Zero Pressure and selecting Lower Sensor Trim (HART Quick Key 1,
2, 5, 1, 3, 2) and following the prompts on the HART Communicator. When complete, apply a known
calibrated full scale pressure to the Transmitter and selecting Upper Sensor Trim (HART Quick Key 1,
2, 5, 1, 3, 3) and follow the prompts on the HART Communicator. When complete, the transmitter
electronics will have adjusted the digital PV to correct to full scale output.
""
ATTENTION
Never perform upper sensor trim without performing lower sensor trim first.
8.1 CONNECTING THE HART HANDHELD COMMUNICATOR
In hazardous areas, refer to the handheld communicator instruction manual for instructions for
HART Communicator to function properly.
ATTENTION
A minimum of 250 Ohms resistance must be present in the loop.
The HART Communicator does not measure loop current directly.
The HART Communicator can interface with the device anywhere along the 4?20 mA cable as shown in
the following figure.
""
6.3.3 PROCEDURE
""
1. Connect Power Supply and HART Communicator per the above diagram.
2. If commissioning on the bench with a dead weight tester or calibrated pressure
source, insure pressure connection is free of leaks.
3. Apply power to the transmitter and turn on the HART Communicator by pressing the
ON/OFF key. The LCD display should show [SPX?T or SPX or Vertex depending on model]
in the upper left corner. If this is not present, consult the Troubleshooting section of
this manual.
4. Set PV Units (Fast Key 1,3,2) to appropriate pressure unit. (e.g. psi, Bar, kgf/cm2, MPa)
5. Set Tag (Fast Key 1,3,1).
6. If transmitter output needs to be re?ranged, set the appropriate LRV (Fast Key 4,1) and
URV (Fast Key 4,2)
"? Note: URV cannot be turned down below the PV Minimum span (Fast Key 1,4,1,5)"
7. Set Lower Trim (Fast Key 1,2,5,1,3,1)
8. Verify the transmitter output. Zero pressure output should read 4 mA.
""
ATTENTION
Steps past this point are not part of a normal bench setup and should only be performed by
qualified individuals, as the device is highly stable and has been factory calibrated with highly
accurate pressure generators. This function should only be performed on such equipment.
""
9. Next, using calibrated pressure source, apply pressure equal to value set in URV in step 6.
Output should equal 20 mA. If output does not equal 20 mA proceed to step 10.
10. To calibrate full scale output, first apply pressure equal to full scale pressure of unit.
Next perform Upper Sensor Trim (Fast Key 1,2,5,1,3,2). Output should now equal full
scale pressure.
11. If Transmitter Output Damping is required, set PV Damping (Fast Key 1,3,5) to the
appropriate value.
12. Press the left arrow key until the HART Communicator is off?line then turn the power off.
""
The pressure transmitter is now ready to be installed in the process.
The device has a 4?20 mA output proportional to pressure for normal operating conditions. However,
unlike a traditional sensor, the device performs self?diagnostic routines continually during operation.
If a special condition is detected, the transmitter drives its analog output outside the normal
saturation values to indicate that investigation is necessary.  (This condition is called fail?safe mode
alarm.)The conditions detected by the self?diagnostic routines (and the corresponding effect on
the analog output) are listed later in this section.
""
When a special condition is detected, the device goes into fail?safe mode and the transmitter output
goes high, by default. However, using a HART communicator, the transmitter can also be configured
to drive its output low or to freeze the output where it was just before the fail?safe was detected. The
actual analog output levels are indicated below.
""
A low alarm (3.6 mA) is possible but not recommended because HART communications are not
guaranteed until the cause of the alarm is removed.
""
Using the HART communicator, the specific condition that triggered the fail?safe mode alarm can be
read for diagnostic purposes.  (See Status in the HART menu tree.)
""
In a fail?safe condition the PV is not affected and can still be read using the handheld HART
communicator. For process related fail?safe conditions, the transmitter will remain in the alarm state
until the source of error disappears. If certain electronics errors are detected, the fail?safe condition
will latch until a reset is performed by either cycling the power or through a software command.
""
NAMUR Compliant Saturation and Alarm Values
4 ? 20 mA Saturation 4 ? 20 mA Alarm
Low 3.8 mA 3.6 mA
High 20.5 mA >21 mA
""
You can alter the actual transmitter mA output values by performing an analog output trim using
the HART Communicator.
""
When a transmitter is in an alarm condition, the analog output displayed by the handheld indicates
the alarm value of the analog output – NOT the value the transmitter would have, if the sensor had
not detected the failure.

8.4 TRANSMITTER FUNCTIONS VIAHART
Zero Trim (1,2,5,1,3,1)
Digital Correction to zero which affects the digital output. This differs from Lower Sensor Trim in that
zero trim is ONLY performed at zero pressure.
""
Lower Sensor Trim (1,2,5,1,3,2)
Digital Correction to zero which affects the digital output. This differs from Zero Trim in that Lower
Sensor Trim can be performed at pressures above zero.Note: This must be performed before Upper
Sensor Trim. Only perform this function with a known calibrated pressure source.
""
Upper Sensor Trim (1,2,5,1,3,3)
Digital correction to Full Scale which affect digital output. Note: Lower Sensor Trim must be
performed before Upper Sensor Trim. Only perform this function with a known calibrated pressure
source.
""
Digital to Analog trim (1,2,5,1,2)
This is used to match the digital representation of the analog output with its actual analog loop
current. Note: This should only be performed with a known Calibrated Current (mA) meter.
""
Reranging
The device allows for the 4 mA and 20 mA points (LRV and URV respectively) to be adjusted so that
output resolution can be improved. A Re?range or “Turndown” ratio of 6:1 is possible. Accuracy
specifications remain dependent upon the Full Sensor Range without any turndown applied. Three
methods of Re? ranging the transmitter are outlined below. Note: If pressure applied to the
transmitter is not in the range of the 6:1 turndown ratio, the transmitter will reject the Span attempt.
This will be indicated by the output not adjusting to 20 mA after a few attempts using the Span
Actuator.
""
Reranging TV (MPT option only)
On a device with the MPT option, there is a second 4?20mA output that is proportional to the snout
temperature. By default the TV LRV and TV URV are set to 0 and 400C respectively. The secondary
4?20mA output can be reranged by changing TV LRV and TV URV.
""
Reranging via Zero/Span Actuators
When HART Communication is not used, LRV and URV values are entered by applying zero pressure to
the device and “Rezeroing” by:
a. For units with Pushbuttons
i. Do not remove seal screw when the circuit is live in a hazardous area.
ii. Remove zero pushbutton seal screw.

Note: The screw must be threaded into the endplate for normal operation. Failing to do so will cause
the device to go into failsafe.
""
The LRV and URV have now been adjusted to zero the device without affecting the
span.
""
After Rezeroing, it is possible to set the span by adjusting the URV with the span actuator. The span
actuator should never be used to adjust the URV without using the zero actuator to set the LRV first.
""
URV or Full Scale Turndown is performed by applying any pressure, within the 6:1 ratio of the
transmitter that you want to be the 20 mA point.  When the pressure is held steady:
a. For units with Pushbuttons
i. Do not remove seal screw when the circuit is live in a hazardous area.
ii. Remove span pushbutton seal screw.
iii. Using a 2mm or smaller Allen key, depress the pushbutton for a 1?2 second.
iv. Release pushbutton for a 1?2 second.
v. Depress the pushbutton again for a 1?2 second and release.
""
b. For units with HALL Switches
i. Unthread Span screw from endplate
ii. Depress screw
iii. Release screw
iv. Depress screw
v. Release screw
vi. Restore screw in endplate
""
""
Note: The screw must be threaded into the endplate for normal operation. Failing to do so will
cause the device to go into failsafe.
""
The device has now adjusted the URV 20 mA point to match the pressure applied.
8.5 RERANGING VIA HART
""
Rerange LRV (4)
This is the pressure at which the transmitter will output 4 mA as entered directly by the user. Changing
the LRV affects the transmitter span so the is range is limited by the minimum span value found in Fast
Key (1,4,1,5)
""
Rerange URV (5)
This is the pressure at which the transmitter will output 20 mA as entered directly by the user. This
range is limited by the minimum span value found in Fast Key (1,4,1,5)
""
Rerange TV LRV (1,3,3,3) MPT option only
This is the temperature at which the transmitter will output 4 mA on the secondary mA output as
entered directly by the user.
""
Rerange TV URV (1,3,3,4) MPT option only
This is the temperature at which the transmitter will output 20 mA on the secondary mA output as
entered directly by the user.
""
Rerange LRV By Applying Pressure (1,2,5,1,1,1,1)
This is done by applying a known pressure and initiating the procedure so that the transmitter adopts
the pressure as the 4 mA point.
""
Note: This should only be performed with a Calibrated Pressure Source.
""
Rerange URV By Applying Pressure (1,2,5,1,1,1,2)
This is done by applying a known pressure and initiating the procedure so that the transmitter adopts
the pressure as the 20 mA point.
Note: This should only be performed with a Calibrated Pressure Source.
""
Recall Factory Trim (1,2,5,3)
This is used to restore the Zero, Lower, and Upper Trim to the Values as set from the Factory.
""
R?Cal Set % (1,2,5,1,4,1)
This is used on versions with a Rcal. By activating R?Cal, the output will be set to the percentage of span
set by this function. Default is 80%. Setting Rcal to 0%, disables the Rcal function.
""
Damping (1,3,5)
The damping time constant affects the speed with which the primary output signal reacts to changes in
pressure as shown in the figure on the following page. Damping is off by default but values between 0
and 30 seconds can be set using the handheld communicator. The damping value must be entered in
integers. If non?integers are entered, the system rounds to the next integer.
""
Local Actuator Disable (1,4,3,6)
Local zero and span actuators can be disabled using the HART handheld communicator function
"“Local Push?buttons.” When turned off, the software Lock Out prevents changes to transmitter range"
points via the local zero and span actuators. With local Push?buttons disabled, changes to
configuration are still possible via HART.
""
Status (1,2,1,2)
Reads Device Status from device.
""
PV Unit (1,3,2)
The pressure unit defines the unit of measure that the pressure?specific parameters are transmitted
in. The device can be configured in the engineering units of psi, Bar, MPa, and kgf/cm2 or as a
percentage of Full Scale (FS). After selecting a new pressure unit, all entries for pressure are
recalculated to the new unit, using the following conversion rules:
""
1 psi = 0.068947 Bar = 0.0068947 MPa = 0.070309 kgf/cm2
""
Tag (1,3,1)
An inventory “Tag” identification number may be stored in transmitter memory (8 characters
maximum). Software tag is a single question mark by default.
""
Descriptor (1,3,4,2)
A 16 character text can be entered for further description of transmitter e.g. location, function,
position, etc.
""
Message (1,3,4,3)
A 20 character message can be set and displayed on the HART Communicator.
""
SV Electronics Temperature (1,1,7)
Temperature measured on the Electronics Assembly is used for reference and factory diagnostics
only.
""
TV Snout Temperature (1,1,4)
Temperature measured at the snout tip (MPT option only).
Poll Address (1,4,3,3,3)
Use in Multidrop mode allows more than one transmitter (up to 15) on a single loop. If this
value is other than zero, the transmitter is in Multidrop mode. An example of Multidrop mode
would be a group of HART devices wired in parallel on a single powered loop and each device
being assigned a unique Poll address (1?15). The HART communicator would prompt for the
individual address of the transmitter to communicate with and would only poll that specific
device. All others would remain unchanged. Note: Analog output is set to 4mA when in multi?
drop mode.
""
Burst Mode (1,4,2,3,1)
When the device is used in Burst Mode, the transmitter outputs one?way digital communications
from the transmitter to the Host. Communication rate is faster since the transmitter does not
have to be polled to send data. Information transmitted in Burst Mode includes Pressure
Variable, Analog Output value, Pressure in % of range. Access to other information can still be
obtained through normal HART Comms.
""
8.6 RESETTING TO FACTORY DEFAULT SETTINGS
The factory settings for the sensor (including zero and span) can be restored if they are changed
inadvertently using the Zero/Span Actuators or the HART communicator.The list of parameters
restored is shown below.
""
Make sure Control System is in Manual mode. Temporary loss of Loop
Output during Electronics Re?boot may occur.
""
To reset the sensor using the actuators, use the following procedure:
a. For units with Pushbuttons
i. Do not remove seal screw when the circuit is live in a hazardous area.
ii. Remove zero and span pushbutton seal screws.
iii. Using a 2mm or smaller Allen key, depress the pushbuttons for a 1?2 second.
iv. Release pushbuttons for a 1?2 second.
v. Depress the pushbuttons again for a 1?2 second and release.
""
b. For units with HALL Switches
i. Unthread Zero and Span screws from endplate
ii. Depress screws
iii. Release screws
iv. Depress screws
v. Release screws
vi. Restore screws in endplate
Note: The screws must be threaded into the endplate for normal operation. Failing to do so
will cause the device to go into failsafe.
""
At this point, the LRV and URV will be set to factory defaults.
8.7  DEFINITION OF “RESTORE FACTORYDEFAULTS”
1. Restore LRV and URV to their values at shipment.
2. Restore the Pressure Unit (psi, Bar, etc.) to its value at shipment.
3. Set the Analog Output Alarm Level to its value at shipment.
